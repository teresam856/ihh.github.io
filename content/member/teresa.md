# Biography
As an undergraduate, I quickly became fascinated in the application of computer science to solve biology based problems which led to me to take interest in bioinformatics and biomedical imaging.

After completing my degree at Berkeley, I moved to Washington D.C to work as a software engineer. During my time there, I began to experiment with web development tools and devOps to build full stack applications and micro services.

I joined the JBrowse team in 2020 right before the first release of JBrowse2. As a developer for the JBrowse project, I really enjoy working and learning from a passionate team of individuals collaborating to provide the open source community with high quality software.
